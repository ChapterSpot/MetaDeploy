# ProgressIndicator

**Communicates the progress of an installation.**

## Overview

The **ProgressIndicator** component is an [SLDS Progress Indicator](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicators/) used to communicate to the user the progress of an installation.

The **ProgressIndicator** has two main steps: `Login` (or `Create a Scratch Org`) and `Install`.

If pre-install validation is required, another step is added before `Install`.

The `Install` step is empty at the start of installation. `Completed` steps are represented by checkmarks.

`Canceled` or `Failed` steps show an error symbol.
