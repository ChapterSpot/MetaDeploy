# UserInfo

** Shows information about the Salesforce Org during an installation Job.**

## Overview

The **UserInfo** component is an
[SLDS Card](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/cards/) used to
display information about the Salesforce Org during an installation **Job**.

## States

If the installation Job is running on a temporary Scratch Org, the card shows
the expiration date of the Org and displays a message regarding what will happen
when the Org expires.

If the installation Job is running on an persistent Salesforce Org, the heading
displays a User profile icon and reads "Salesforce Org Information." The
component also shows the Org owner's email, Org name, and Org type, if the
information is provided.
