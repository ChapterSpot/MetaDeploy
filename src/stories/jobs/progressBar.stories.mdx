# ProgressBar

**Visualizes the progress of an installation Job.**

## Overview

The **ProgressBar** component is an
[SLDS Progress Bar](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-bars/)
used to visually communciate the completion of `Steps` within a `Job`
installation.

The **ProgressBar** appears once an installation has started. The component is
labeled "Installation Progress:" and updates the percentage of `Steps`
completed. The completed `Steps` percentage is represented by a colored bar and
a number that grow as the install continues.

The entire bar is filled with a solid green color at one percent completion. If
the the installation fails or or is canceled, the entire **ProgressBar** turns
red and the respective status is inserted after the "Installation Progress:"
label.
