The **ProgressBar** appears once an installation has started. The component is
labeled "Installation Progress:" and updates the percentage of `Steps` completed
as the install continues, represented by a number and a colored bar.

The entire bar is filled with a solid green color at one percent completion. If
the the installation fails or or is canceled, the entire bar turns red and the
respective status is inserted after the "Installation Progress:" label.
