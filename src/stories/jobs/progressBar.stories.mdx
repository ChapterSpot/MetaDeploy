# ProgressBar

**Visualizes the progress of an installation Job.**

## Overview

The **ProgressBar** component is an
[SLDS Progress Bar](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-bars/)
used to visually communciate the completion of `Steps` within a `Job`
installation.

The **ProgressBar** appears once an installation has started. The component is
labeled "Installation Progress" and updates the percentage of `Steps` completed.
The completed `Steps` percentage is represented by a striped bar that grows as
the install continues.

## Progress Rate

To provide users with a sense of continuous movement, the component updates
every one hundred milliseconds.

Inidividual `Steps` progress over a span of fifteen seconds. In that time, the
`ProgressBar` moves from showing the actual completion percentage of a `Step` to
eighty percent completion of the `Step`.

At that point the bar pauses until the `Step` is fully installed. Next, the
`ProgressBar` moves to a position equivalent to twenty percent completion of the
following `Step`.

This process repeats until all `Steps` are installed, at which point the entire
bar turns solid green.

If the installation fails or is canceled, the **ProgressBar** turns red and the
respective status is inserted after the "Installation Progress:" label.
