# StepsTable
**Shows detailed information about the Steps of an installation.**

## Overview
 The **StepsTable** component is an [SLDS Data Table](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
 used to display information about each **Step** involved in
  installing a **Product** or **Plan**.

If a pre-install validation check is required, the
**StepsTable** initially only displays columns for
each **Step** name and type.

Once the installation process is able to be started,
an `Install` column appears. If a **Step** is required,
the `Install` column for that **Step** is checked.
If the **Step** is optional, checkbox that can
be selected is shown.

The table features columns for the name, type, and
install status of each **Step**.
