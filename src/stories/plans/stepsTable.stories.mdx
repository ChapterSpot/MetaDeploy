# StepsTable

**Shows detailed information about the Steps of an installation.**

## Overview

The **StepsTable** component is an
[SLDS Data Table](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
used to display information about each **Step** involved in installing a
**Plan**.

The table features columns for the name, type, and install status of each
**Step**.

If a pre-install validation check is required, the **StepsTable** initially only
displays columns for each **Step** name and type.

Once the installation process is able to begin, an `Install` column appears. If
a **Step** is required, the `Install` column for that **Step** features a
checkmark. If the **Step** is optional, a checkbox that can be selected is shown
instead.

Once the installation process has begun for a **Step**, a toggle button appears
at the beginning of each **Step** name. Clicking on the button toggles an
expanded log of information about the time, status, and detailed processes of
the **Step**.

When an installation **Step** is complete, a round, green icon with a white
checkmark appears in the `Install` column.

A toggle button for hiding or expanding all logs appears in the `Steps` column
once the first **Step** starts to transmit log data.

If a **Step** fails or is not installed a gray dash is shown in the `Install`
column.
