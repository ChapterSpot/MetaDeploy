# StepsTable

**Shows detailed information about the Steps of an installation.**

## Overview

The **StepsTable** component is an
[SLDS Data Table](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
used to display information about each **Step** involved in installing a
**Plan**.

If a pre-install validation check is required, the **StepsTable** initially only
displays **Step** names and types.

Once the pre-install validation is complete, an `Install` column appears. If a
**Step** is required, the `Install` column for that **Step** features a
checkmark. If it is optional, a selectable checkbox is shown instead.

If the pre-install validation check generates a warning, the **Step** is
highlighted orange, displays a warning symbol, and lists the warning message(s).

Red is shown if the validation discovers an error, along with an error symbol
and messages detailing each error.

A pre-validation validation can also mark a **Step** as optional.

During the installation process for a **Step**, a toggle button appears next to
its name. Clicking on the button toggles an expanded log of information about
the time, status, and detailed processes of the **Step**.

When an installation **Step** is complete, a round, green icon with a white
checkmark appears in the `Install` column.

A toggle button for hiding or expanding logs for the active step (or all steps,
if the installation is not running) appears in the `Steps` column header once
the first **Step** starts to transmit log data.

Skipped **Steps** display a gray dash in the `Install` column. If a **Step**
fails its status is labeled as `Error` and an error message is shown below the
**Step** name.
