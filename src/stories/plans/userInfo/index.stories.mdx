# UserInfo

** Shows information about a User installing a Plan.**

## Overview

The **UserInfo** component is an
[SLDS Card](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/cards/) used to
display information about the User installing a **Plan**.

## States

On a Product page, before a User has logged in, the **UserInfo** component shows
an illustration and text that informs the User that they are not authenticated
with a Salesforce Org.

/>

Once a User connects to a Salesforce Org, the component shows the User's email,
Org name, and Org type. The header reads "Connected to Salesforce" and a message
explains for how long the User's credentials will be valid.

A message in the footer provides a link to a dropdown menu that gives the User
the ability to log in with a different organization.
