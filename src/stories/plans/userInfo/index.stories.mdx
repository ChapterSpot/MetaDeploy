# UserInfo

** Shows information about a User installing a Plan.**

## Overview

The **UserInfo** component is an
[SLDS Card](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/cards/) used to
display information about the Salesforce Org for installing a **Plan**.

## States

On a Product page for a Plan that requires connecting to an existing Org, before
a User has connected the **UserInfo** component shows an illustration and text
that reads "Not Connected to Salesforce."

Once a User connects to a Salesforce Org, the component shows the Org owner's
email, Org name, and Org type, if the information is provided. The header reads
"Connected to Salesforce" and a message explains for how long the User's
credentials will be valid. A message in the footer provides a link to a dropdown
menu that gives the User the ability to log in with a different Org.

If a Plan allows connecting to Salesforce through a temporary Scratch Org, the
**UserInfo** component shows the number of days before the Org will expire, and
a message warning what happens when the Org expires.

Once a Scratch Org has been created, the component displays the exact date when
the Org will expire.
