# UserInfo

** Shows information about a User installing a Plan.**

## Overview

The **UserInfo** component is an
[SLDS Card](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/cards/) used to
display information about the Salesforce Org for installing a **Plan**.

## States

On a Product page, before a User has connected to a Salesforce Org, the
**UserInfo** component shows an illustration and text that reads "Not Connected
to Salesforce."

<Story

  height="330px"
/>

Once a User connects to a Salesforce Org, the component shows the Org owner's
email, Org name, and Org type, if the information is provided. The header reads
"Connected to Salesforce" and a message explains for how long the User's
credentials will be valid.

A message in the footer provides a link to a dropdown menu that gives the User
the ability to log in with a different Org.

If a User connects to Salesforce through a Scratch Org, the **UserInfo**
component shows the expiration date of the Org and displays a message warning
what happens when the Org expires.

The date can either be shown as an amount of remaining days ...

<Story
  id="plans-userinfo-examples--org-user-info-component&args=scratchOrg:Days+Remaining"
  height="250px"
/>

or as a particular date.

<Story
  id="plans-userinfo-examples--org-user-info-component&args=scratchOrg:Expiration+Date"
  height="250px"
/>
