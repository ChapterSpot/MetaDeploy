# UserInfo

** Shows information about a User installing a Plan.**

## Overview

The **UserInfo** component is an
[SLDS Card](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/cards/) used to
display information about the Salesforce Org for installing a **Plan**.

## States

On a Product page, before a User has logged in, the **UserInfo** component shows
an illustration and text that informs the User that they are not authenticated
with a Salesforce Org.

  height="330px"
/>

Once a User connects to a Salesforce Org, the component shows the Org owner's
email, Org name, and Org type. The header reads "Connected to Salesforce" and a
message explains for how long the User's credentials will be valid.

  height="330px"
/>

A message in the footer provides a link to a dropdown menu that gives the User
the ability to log in with a different organization.

If a User connects to Salesforce through a Scratch Org, the **UserInfo**
component shows when the expiration date of the Org and displays a message
explaining what happens when the Org expires.

The date can either be shown as an amount of remaining days ...

<Story
  id="plans-userinfo-examples--org-user-info&args=scratchOrg:Days"

/>

or as a particular date.

<Story
  id="plans-userinfo-examples--org-user-info&args=scratchOrg:Date"
  height="250px"
/>
